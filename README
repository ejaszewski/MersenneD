MersenneD

MersenneD aims to be a lightweight, fast Mersenne Prime finding program. The application is written entirely in the D programming language, and uses the built-in Big Integer class.

Currently Implemented Features:
    1. Lucas-Lehmer Primality Test
        - No division modulus (using iterative shifts, bitwise &, and addition)
        - Post-square and modulus subtraction
        - Limited heap allocation
    2. Basic Sieve of Eratosthenes for p-value generation
    3. Per-Test timing system using D-lang Stopwatch (nano-/milli-second precision)

Planned Features:
    1. Trial Division test (to improve overall performance)
    2. P-1 Factoring test (to improve overall performance)
    3. Command-Line interface 
    4. Multi-Threading
    5. Checkpointing & State saving
    6. Improved Prime Sieve
